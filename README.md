# awesome-cyber-civil-society-actors

This whole repo is based on an idea from tarkaja, who facilitated a survey within Security without borders. Based on the data an awesome list was created to be curated. The focus is to list organisations that
somehow affect cyber-civil-society

A Preliminary Survey Of Civil Society Actors

    The survey can be found at:

    https://ethercalc.org/m5ovdzu7blw4


Security Without Borders (SWB) describes itself as, "assisting journalists, human rights defenders, and non-profit organizations".

    "Are you an activist, journalist, or human rights defender?"

A person looking at the website might ask themself, "I don't know, am I? I'm no Edward Snowden or Laura Poitras, that's for sure. I'm not a member of Amnesty and I doubt my affinity group qualifies as a NPO."

So who does SWB support? Should distinctions be made between journalists and writers for example, or between NPO's and community organizations?

To explore these questions, lets use the encompassing term 'civil society' to describe the four actors mentioned above and then look at who else falls under the same umbrella.

A preliminary survey of civil society actors can be found here:

    https://ethercalc.org/m5ovdzu7blw4

It lists and describes types of civil society actors, offers a recognisable example of each type and links to more comprehensive lists of individual organisations.

Think of it as a 'map' that illustrates the scope and diversity of civil society beyond the examples given.

Some observations:

    - Within any type, there are individuals across the spectrum (e.g. both pro-choice and pro-life activists believe they are fighting injustices)

    - The diversity of individuals within each type is as broad as across types (e.g. animal rights activists may have more affinity with fair trade farming co-ops than disability rights activists)

I hope this survey is helpful as a resource to both SWB and civil society actors.

Please feel free to offer your corrections and/or suggestions to both this document and survey itself.
